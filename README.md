## Project Overview

Development of an Artificial Intelligence for Music Recognition, implemented in Python with the following libraries: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.

## Key Features

- **Audio Analysis:** Developed advanced audio spectral analysis algorithms to extract harmonic features and identify fundamental musical notes in songs.

- **Signal Processing:** Utilized signal processing techniques for efficient analysis, leveraging Python libraries such as NumPy and SciPy.

- **Similarity Measurement:** Employed Mean Square Error (MSE) algorithms to quantify the similarity between different musical structures.

- **Data Visualization:** Integrated data visualization tools to represent the analyzed spectrograms and harmony comparisons for enhanced interpretability.
